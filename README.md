## Introduction
This repository begins as a **Simple Java Roadmap** designed to guide developers through essential Java programming concepts. Over time, it will evolve into a comprehensive **Backend Roadmap**, covering broader backend technologies and practices.

## Java Roadmap
The repository currently explores the following topics in Java:

- **Conditionals**
  - Control flow statements such as `if`, `else`, `switch`.

- **Data Structures**
  - Arrays, Graphs, Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Trees

- **Design Patterns**
  - Behavioral, Creational, Structural

- **Functions**
  - Usage and declaration of functions.

- **Loops**
  - `for`, `while`, `do-while` comparisons.

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
  - Abstract classes, association, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

- **SOLID Principles**
  - Dependency Inversion, Interface Segregation, Liskov Substitution, Open/Closed, Single Responsibility.

- **Syntax**
  - Basic syntax, data types, variables, records.

- **Threads**
  - Thread lifecycle, management.

## Future Backend Roadmap
As this repository evolves, it will expand to include:

- **Spring Boot**
  - Comprehensive examples and tutorials for developing backend applications.

- **Database Integration**
  - Techniques for integrating with PostgreSQL and various NoSQL databases.

- **Microservices**
  - Design and architecture of scalable and independent microservice systems.

- **API Development**
  - Best practices for designing robust and secure APIs.

- **Security and Performance**
  - Ensuring backend systems are secure, reliable, and performant.
